# hello-world

Hello to all the creators out there!

My name is Teyla. I'm from NJ.

I am a full stack web developer who loves design and creating new things. 
Im excited to expand my tech stack and get into mobile app development next.

Hope you enjoy the projects I create, as much as I enjoy creating them!
Ciao!
